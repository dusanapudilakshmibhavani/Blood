For this project, we used the technologies like:
“HTML” for structuring content.
 “CSS” for styling and interactivity.
 “PHP” for server-side scripting. 
“MySQL” for database management.
Server(localhost):XAMPP
In the current scenario, the demand for blood is rapidly increasing due to various reasons.We are also striving to raise awareness among donors through our page by 
providing detailed information about blood donation.Besides facilitating blood donation and receiving, we aim to express our gratitude to donors through a heartfelt
message.We also offer an easy-to-use registration process for donors, making it convenient for them to sign up and participate in upcoming blood donation events.
  This design maintains a clean and professional look, aligning with the mission of the organization.Visual elements effectively convey the message of blood donation
and the importance of participating.We  offer an easy-to-use registration process for donors, making it convenient for them to sign up and participate in upcoming 
blood donation events.Our platform provides administrators with comprehensive tools to manage donor registrations , update blood donation events , and ensure efficient
communication with donors.This Admin Dashboard where he can see the details of the registered donors and also he can see the Blood donation registration Details.The admin
can update the details of the blood donation camps conducted when he click the button update camp details.This shows how the admin update the details of the blood donation events.
This is the page where the donor can view the venues updated by the admin.After viewing the venues he can register to the particular event he is comforted with.Once the donor click the register
button then he first undergo an eligible test consisting of some questions based on blood donation.If he is once eligible to that test then he goes to next page.After the donor eligible for donation
he should register for that particular event.After the donor donating the blood the admin will update  the donated details of the donated donor.After the admin updated the details of a donated person
then the details will be displayed in the admin dashboard.By clicking on thank you button admin can send thank you message to the particular donor.Once the donor successfully donated the blood then 
he will receive the gratitude message through whatsapp .The Donor who already donated the blood tries to donate the blood with in the span of six months then the alert message will displayed at the donor side while 
registering for any event again.And he will not be able to register again.Once the time of the event is expired then the record will be disappeared automatically.
And I also added a feature of sending Whatsapp messages to donors in emergency scenarios.I used php to send whatsapp message through web interface only.
Finally I conclude that the whatsapp messages are sent in two scenarios in this project one is after donating the blood a gratittude mwssage will be sent and in the case when the urgent blood is required also whatsapp alerts will be sent which notify donors about urgency of  blood donation.
